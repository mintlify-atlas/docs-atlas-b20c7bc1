title: What are Unikernels?
description: Understanding unikernels and why Unikraft is the next-generation unikernel development kit
---

## Introduction to Unikernels

Unikernels are specialized, single-purpose operating systems designed to run a single application as efficiently as possible. Unlike traditional operating systems that support multiple applications and users, unikernels are built specifically for one application, containing only the minimal set of operating system components required to run that application.

<Note>
Unikraft is a radical, yet Linux-compatible with effortless tooling, technology for running applications as highly optimized, lightweight and single-purpose virtual machines.
</Note>

## How Unikernels Differ from Traditional OSes

Traditional operating systems like Linux contain millions of lines of code to support a wide variety of hardware, applications, and use cases. Most of this code is never used by any single application. Unikernels take a different approach:

  <Card title="Traditional OS" icon="server">
    - General-purpose design
    - Supports multiple applications
    - Large codebase (millions of LoC)
    - Slow boot times (seconds to minutes)
    - Higher memory footprint
    - Larger attack surface
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unikernel" icon="rocket">
    - Application-specific design
    - Single application per image
    - Minimal codebase (only what's needed)
    - Millisecond boot times
    - Minimal memory footprint
    - Reduced attack surface
  </Card>

## Why Unikraft?

Unikraft addresses the need for efficiency in modern computing environments. In today's cloud and edge computing landscape, resources are precious and performance is paramount.

### Key Benefits

#### Instantaneous Cold-boots

While Linux-based systems might take tens of seconds to boot, Unikraft will be up in milliseconds. This enables:
- Rapid scaling in response to demand
- Efficient serverless architectures
- Near-instant failover and recovery

#### Optimized for Performance

Built for performance from the ground up, Unikraft minimizes overheads and leverages platform-specific optimizations, ensuring applications achieve peak performance levels.

```c
// Example: Minimal boot sequence in Unikraft
// Only essential initialization is performed
void _ukplat_entry(void) {
    ukplat_entry_argp(NULL, cmdline, sizeof(cmdline));
}
```

#### Reduced Attack Surface

By selectively including only necessary components, Unikraft reduces the attack surface significantly. Security benefits include:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Minimal Code Base">
    Only the code your application needs is included. No unused kernel modules, drivers, or system utilities that could contain vulnerabilities.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Shell Access">
    Unikernels typically don't include shells or system utilities that attackers could exploit to gain control.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hardware-Level Isolation">
    When running as virtual machines, unikernels benefit from hardware-level isolation provided by hypervisors.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Efficient Resource Utilization

Unikraft optimizes resource utilization, leading to:
- Smaller image sizes (often under 1MB)
- Lower memory consumption
- Higher server saturation
- Reduced infrastructure costs

<Info>
Unikraft images can be as small as a few hundred kilobytes, compared to hundreds of megabytes for container images with full OS distributions.
</Info>

### Modular Design Philosophy

Unikraft boasts a modular design approach, allowing developers to include only necessary components. This results in leaner and more efficient operating system configurations.

The framework includes **80+ internal libraries** covering:
- Memory allocators (binary buddy, region, pool)
- Schedulers (cooperative, preemptive)
- Network stacks and protocols
- File systems (ramfs, 9pfs, virtiofs)
- POSIX compatibility layers
- Device drivers and platform support

## Flexible Architecture Support

Unikraft supports multiple hardware architectures:
