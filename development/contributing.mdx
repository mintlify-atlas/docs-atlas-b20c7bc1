## Getting Started

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with:

- The [coding conventions](/development/coding-conventions) used throughout the project
- The [patch submission process](/development/submitting-patches) for getting your changes merged
- The Unikraft codebase structure and architecture

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Unikraft:

- **Bug Fixes**: Help identify and fix issues in the codebase
- **New Features**: Implement new functionality or improvements
- **Documentation**: Improve or expand project documentation
- **Code Review**: Review pull requests from other contributors
- **Testing**: Test new features and report issues
- **Community Support**: Help other users on community channels

## Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork and Clone">
    Fork the Unikraft repository and clone it to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unikraft.git
    cd unikraft
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Branch">
    Create a new branch for your changes:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-branch
    ```
    
    Use descriptive branch names that reflect the changes you're making.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Changes">
    Implement your changes following the [coding conventions](/development/coding-conventions).
    
    Ensure your changes:
    - Follow the project's coding style
    - Include appropriate documentation
    - Are tested against relevant architectures and platforms
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Changes">
    Before submitting, test your changes thoroughly:
    
    - Build Unikraft with your changes
    - Run relevant test cases
    - Verify functionality on target platforms
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Code Quality Checks">
    Run the checkpatch script to verify your code meets quality standards:
    
    ```bash
    ./support/scripts/checkpatch.uk -f path/to/your/file.c
    ```
    
    Or check your commits:
    
    ```bash
    ./support/scripts/checkpatch.uk -g HEAD~1..HEAD
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit Changes">
    Commit your changes with a proper commit message following the [commit message format](/development/submitting-patches#commit-message-format).
    
    **Important**: All commits must include a DCO sign-off line:
    
    ```bash
    git commit -s -m "component: Brief description of changes"
    ```
    
    The `-s` flag automatically adds the `Signed-off-by:` line.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push and Create PR">
    Push your branch and create a pull request:
    
    ```bash
    git push origin your-feature-branch
    ```
    
    Then open a pull request on GitHub following the [PR guidelines](/development/submitting-patches#pull-request-process).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions to Unikraft must include a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off. This certifies that you have the right to submit the code and agree to the [DCO terms](https://developercertificate.org/).

### Adding the Sign-off

To add the DCO sign-off to your commits, use the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This adds a `Signed-off-by:` line with your name and email:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### Automated Checks

All pull requests are automatically checked for DCO sign-off. PRs without proper sign-off will fail the CI checks and cannot be merged.

## Code Review Process

Once you submit a pull request:

1. **Automated Checks**: GitHub Actions will run automated checks including:
   - DCO sign-off verification
   - Commit message format validation
   - Code style checks (checkpatch)

2. **Maintainer Review**: Project maintainers will review your changes and may:
   - Request modifications
   - Ask for clarification
   - Suggest improvements

3. **Iterate**: Address review feedback by:
   - Making requested changes
   - Pushing new commits to your branch
   - Responding to comments

4. **Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request
