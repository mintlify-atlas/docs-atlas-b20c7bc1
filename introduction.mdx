## What is Unikraft?

Unikraft is a radical, yet Linux-compatible technology for running applications as highly optimized, lightweight and single-purpose virtual machines (known as unikernels). With Unikraft, you can build custom operating systems tailored to your specific application requirements, achieving best-in-class performance, security, and efficiency.

## Why Unikraft?

In today's computing landscape, efficiency is paramount. Traditional operating systems carry significant overhead with features and drivers your application may never use. Unikraft addresses this by enabling you to build only what you need.

<Note>
Unikraft's modular design allows developers to create customized, lightweight operating systems tailored to specific application requirements, trimming excess overhead and minimizing attack surfaces.
</Note>

### Key Benefits

**Modular Design**: Unikraft boasts a modular architecture, allowing developers to include only necessary components. This results in leaner and more efficient operating system configurations.

**Flexible Architecture Support**: With support for x86, ARM, and soon RISC-V architectures, Unikraft offers flexibility in deployment across diverse hardware platforms.

**Broad Language Support**: Extensive support for multiple programming languages including C, C++, Rust, Go, Python, Node.js, and more.

**Cloud and Edge Compatible**: Designed for cloud and edge computing environments, enabling seamless deployment across distributed computing infrastructures.

**Developer Friendly**: Intuitive toolchain and user-friendly interface simplify the development process, allowing developers to focus on building innovative solutions.

**Community-Driven**: Open-source project driven by a vibrant community of over 100 developers from industry and academia.

## Architecture Overview

Unikraft is built on three core principles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Modularity">
    Everything in Unikraft is a library. The core kernel, drivers, filesystems, and even your application are all modular components that can be included or excluded based on your needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Single Address Space">
    Unikernels run in a single address space, eliminating the overhead of user-kernel space transitions. This design choice dramatically improves performance for I/O operations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Static Linking">
    All components are statically linked at build time, enabling aggressive compiler optimizations and dead code elimination.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

Unikraft is ideal for:

- **Microservices**: Deploy lightweight, fast-booting services with minimal overhead
- **Edge Computing**: Run efficient applications in resource-constrained edge environments
- **Serverless Functions**: Achieve millisecond cold-start times for serverless workloads
- **Network Functions**: Build high-performance network appliances and functions
- **Embedded Systems**: Create minimal, security-focused systems for embedded devices

## Performance Highlights

<Tip>
Unikraft applications typically boot in 1-10 milliseconds and consume 1-10 MB of memory, compared to hundreds of milliseconds and hundreds of megabytes for containerized applications.
</Tip>
