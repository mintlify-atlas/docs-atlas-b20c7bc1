## Get up and running fast

This guide will have you running your first Unikraft unikernel in under 5 minutes. No prior experience with unikernels required.

<Tip>
Already have `kraft` installed? Jump to [Run your first unikernel](#run-your-first-unikernel).
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Unix-like operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL)
- Internet connection for downloading the kraft CLI and images

<Note>
For detailed installation instructions including platform-specific requirements, see the [Installation](/installation) guide.
</Note>

## Install kraft CLI

The `kraft` CLI is your companion tool for building and running Unikraft unikernels. Install it with a single command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS / Linux / Windows
curl -sSfL https://get.kraftkit.sh | sh
```

```bash Homebrew (macOS)
brew install unikraft/cli/kraftkit
```
</CodeGroup>

The interactive installer will automatically:

- Download the appropriate kraft binary for your platform
- Install it to your system PATH
- Verify the installation

<Tip>
If you encounter permission issues, you may need to run with `sudo` or install to a user directory. See the [Installation](/installation) guide for troubleshooting.
</Tip>

### Verify Installation

Confirm that kraft is installed correctly:

```bash
kraft version
```

You should see output showing the kraft version:

```bash
kraft 0.7.0 ()
```

## Run your first unikernel

Now for the exciting part! Let's run a pre-built unikernel from the Unikraft community catalog:

```bash
kraft run unikraft.org/helloworld:latest
```

This command will:

1. Pull the `helloworld` unikernel image from the Unikraft registry
2. Launch it in a lightweight virtual machine
3. Display the output

<Steps>
  <Step title="First run">
    On your first run, kraft will download the image. This may take a few seconds depending on your connection.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="See the output">
    You should see "Hello, World!" printed to your terminal, followed by boot time metrics showing the unikernel booting in milliseconds.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clean exit">
    The unikernel will complete execution and exit automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Expected Output

```bash
[    0.000000] Info: [libkvmplat] <setup.c @  346> Entering from KVM (x86)...
[    0.000000] Info: [libkvmplat] <setup.c @  101> bootinfo: 0x9f000
[    0.000000] Info: [libukboot] <boot.c @  128> Unikraft 0.20.0~kiviuq
[    0.002317] Info: [libukboot] <boot.c @  134> Architecture: x86_64
[    0.003148] Info: [libukboot] <boot.c @  140> Boot time: 3.148 ms
Hello, World!
[    0.005492] Info: [libukboot] <boot.c @  175> Unikraft halted
```

<Note>
The exact boot time will vary based on your hardware, but should be in the single-digit millisecond range.
</Note>

## Manage running instances

Kraft provides Docker-like commands for managing unikernel instances.

### View running instances

List all running instances:

```bash
kraft ps
```

### View all instances (including stopped)

```bash
kraft ps --all
```

### Stop a running instance

```bash
kraft stop <instance-name>
```

### Remove an instance

```bash
kraft rm <instance-name>
```

## Explore the catalog

The Unikraft community maintains a catalog of pre-built applications you can run immediately.

```bash
kraft pkg ls --update --apps
```

This will display a list of applications across multiple languages:

## Build your first unikernel

Ready to build your own unikernel? You can containerize existing applications by creating a `Kraftfile`.

### Create a Kraftfile

A `Kraftfile` is similar to a Dockerfile and defines how your application should be packaged as a unikernel.

Create a file named `Kraftfile` in your project directory:

```yaml
spec: v0.6

runtime: base:latest

rootfs: ./Dockerfile

cmd: ["/path/to/my-server-app"]
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Specify the spec version">
    The `spec` field defines which Kraftfile syntax version to use. Use `v0.6` for the latest features.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose a runtime">
    The `runtime` specifies the base unikernel runtime. For most applications, `base:latest` provides a POSIX-compatible environment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define your rootfs">
    The `rootfs` can point to an existing Dockerfile, allowing you to reuse your container build process.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set the command">
    The `cmd` specifies which binary to execute when the unikernel boots.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Build and run

Once you have your Kraftfile configured:

```bash
kraft run .
```

Kraft will:

1. Build your rootfs from the Dockerfile
2. Package it with the Unikraft runtime
3. Launch the resulting unikernel

<Tip>
For a more detailed guide on building custom unikernels and using advanced Kraftfile features, see the [Kraftfile syntax documentation](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli/reference/kraftfile/latest).
</Tip>

## Example: Simple C Application

Here's a complete example of building a simple C application as a unikernel.

### Create the application

Create a file named `main.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    char str[1024], *p;

    strcpy(str, "There's the way it ought to be");
    printf("%s\n", str);

    strcat(str, " and there's the way it is");
    p = strchr(str, 'b');
    p += 2;
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", p);

    return 0;
}
```

### Create a Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` to build your application:

```dockerfile
FROM gcc:latest AS build

WORKDIR /app
COPY main.c .
RUN gcc -o myapp main.c

FROM scratch
COPY --from=build /app/myapp /myapp
```

### Create a Kraftfile

```yaml
spec: v0.6

runtime: base:latest

rootfs: ./Dockerfile

cmd: ["/myapp"]
```

### Build and run

```bash
kraft run .
```

Your application will be packaged as a unikernel and executed!

## Try in the cloud

Want to try Unikraft without installing anything? Use GitHub Codespaces:

<Card title="Open in GitHub Codespaces" icon="github" href="https://codespaces.new/unikraft/catalog">
  Launch a pre-configured development environment in your browser
</Card>

## Container build environment

Prefer to use Docker? Run kraft in a container with all dependencies included:

```bash
docker run --platform linux/x86_64 -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  --entrypoint bash \
  kraftkit.sh/base:latest
```

This command:

- Mounts your current directory to `/workspace` in the container
- Drops you into a bash shell with kraft pre-installed
- Includes all build dependencies for emulation mode

<Warning>
Type `exit` or press Ctrl+D to quit the container shell.
</Warning>
